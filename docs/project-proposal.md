# Project Proposal: Roses & Clovers Properties

## Project Name

Roses & Clovers Properties – Rental Property Management System

## Target Audience

Small to mid-sized property managers and individual landlords who manage multiple rental properties and need a simple, centralized system to track properties, tenants, and leases.

## Problem Statement

Many property managers rely on spreadsheets, paper records, or disconnected tools to manage rental operations. These approaches often lead to duplicate data entry, errors, lost information, and inefficient workflows, especially when tracking relationships between properties, tenants, and leases. As the number of properties grows, these manual systems become increasingly difficult to maintain and scale.

## Value Proposition

My app helps property managers organize and manage rental operations by centralizing properties, tenants, and leases into one easy-to-use web application.

## Project Description

Roses & Clovers Properties is a web-based rental property management application designed to streamline core administrative tasks for landlords and property managers. The system focuses on clarity, usability, and data relationships, allowing administrators to manage properties, tenants, and leases from a single dashboard. By structuring data properly and reducing manual processes, the application improves accuracy, efficiency, and visibility across rental operations.

## MVP Feature Scope

The minimum viable product (MVP) will include the following core features:

- Property management (create, view, update, and delete properties)
- Tenant management (create, view, update, and delete tenants)
- Lease management that links tenants to properties
- Admin dashboard with searchable lists and basic summaries
- Secure admin authentication and access control

To maintain focus and ensure timely delivery, the following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- Online rent payments
- Maintenance request tracking
- Messaging or notification systems
- Accounting or financial reporting tools

## Expected Outcome

This project will deliver a functional, well-structured rental management system that demonstrates strong application of business process analysis, requirements definition, and database design principles. The final product will serve as both a practical tool and a portfolio-ready example of applied business and technology integration.
